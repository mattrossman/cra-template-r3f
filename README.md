# Matt's R3F starter

Just the essentials for React and Three.js

- `react-three-fiber` as a base
- `@react-three/drei` for Three.js utilities
- `@react-spring/three` for animations

Scene goes in `App.js`, assets go in `public/`

## Usage:

```
yarn create react-app --template @mattrossman/r3f
```
